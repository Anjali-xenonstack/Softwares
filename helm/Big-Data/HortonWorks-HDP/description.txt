ðŸ¡’ HortonWorks Apache Hadoop Big Data Stack Components :

â€¢ HortonWorks Apache Hadoop ( HDFS NameNode & DataNode + YARN NodeManager & ResourceManager)
â€¢ HortonWorks Apache HBase Master , ThriftServer & RegionServer
â€¢ HortonWorks Apache Hive
â€¢ Cloudera Hue
â€¢ HortonWorks Apache ZooKeeper
â€¢ HortonWorks Apache Oozie
â€¢ HortonWorks Apache Pig
â€¢ HortonWorks Apache Sqoop

Disclaimer : Some components of HortonWorks Apache Hadoop Stack will take some time to initiate for the first time (1-2 minutes)
Hue , particularly will take 3-4 minutes (Only for the first time setup), since Hue syncs all tables & runs migration for all it's components
to External MySQL DB .
Once Hue finishes migration, Users will be able to open Hue instantly anytime later on.

HortonWorks Hadoop HDP-2.6.4 will be deployed with persistent storage for
ðŸ¡’ HDFS NameNode,Datanode
ðŸ¡’ ZooKeeper
ðŸ¡’ MySQL, which acts as an external database for Hue
ðŸ¡’ Postgres for storing Hive Metastore
