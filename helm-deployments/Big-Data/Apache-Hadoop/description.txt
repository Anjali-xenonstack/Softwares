🡒 Apache Hadoop Big Data Stack Components :

• Apache Hadoop ( HDFS NameNode & DataNode + YARN NodeManager & ResourceManager)
• Apache HBase Master , ThriftServer & RegionServer
• Apache Hive
• Cloudera Hue
• Apache ZooKeeper
• Apache Oozie
• Apache Pig
• Apache Sqoop
• Apache Flume

Disclaimer : Some components of Apache Hadoop Stack will take some time to initiate for the first time
Hue , particularly will take 3-4 minutes (Only for the first time setup), since Hue syncs all tables & runs migration for all it's
components to External MySQL DB .
Once Hue finishes migration, Users will be able to open Hue instantly anytime later on.

Apache Hadoop 2.7.3 will be deployed with persistent storage for
🡒 HDFS NameNode,Datanode
🡒 ZooKeeper
🡒 MySQL, which acts as an external database for Hue
🡒 Postgres for storing Hive Metastore

► As an Individual plan user , You will receive following :

2 DataNodes
2 YARN NodeManager nodes

Memory for NameNode :  1 GB
Memory for each DataNode :  1 GB

Storage size for HDFS NameNode : 5 GB
Storage size for HDFS DataNode : 8 GB

Storage size for Hue MySQL : 5 GB
