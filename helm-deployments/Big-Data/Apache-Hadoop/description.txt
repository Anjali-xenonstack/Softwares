ðŸ¡’ Apache Hadoop Big Data Stack Components :

â€¢ Apache Hadoop ( HDFS NameNode & DataNode + YARN NodeManager & ResourceManager)
â€¢ Apache HBase Master , ThriftServer & RegionServer
â€¢ Apache Hive
â€¢ Cloudera Hue
â€¢ Apache ZooKeeper
â€¢ Apache Oozie
â€¢ Apache Pig
â€¢ Apache Sqoop
â€¢ Apache Flume

Disclaimer : Some components of Apache Hadoop Stack will take some time to initiate for the first time
Hue , particularly will take 3-4 minutes (Only for the first time setup), since Hue syncs all tables & runs migration for all it's components to External MySQL DB .
Once Hue finishes migration, Users will be able to open Hue instantly anytime later on.

Apache Hadoop 2.7.3 will be deployed with persistent storage for
ðŸ¡’ HDFS NameNode,Datanode
ðŸ¡’ ZooKeeper
ðŸ¡’ MySQL, which acts as an external database for Hue
ðŸ¡’ Postgres for storing Hive Metastore


â–º As a Individual plan user , You will receive following :

2 DataNodes
2 YARN NodeManager nodes

Memory for NameNode :  1 GB
Memory for each DataNode :  1 GB

Storage size for HDFS NameNode : 5 GB
Storage size for HDFS DataNode : 8 GB

Storage size for Hue MySQL : 5 GB
Storage size for HDFS DataNode : 8 GB
Storage size for ZooKeeper data & logs : 1 GB each

â–º As an Enterprise plan user , You will receive following :

4 DataNodes
5 YARN NodeManager nodes

âž¤ You can also select custom number of nodes as per your requirement as an Enterprise user

Memory for NameNode :  2 GB
Memory for each DataNode :  2 GB

Storage size for HDFS NameNode : 10 GB
Storage size for each HDFS DataNode : 20 GB
Storage size for ZooKeeper data & logs : 3 GB each
